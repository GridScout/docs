## What are session notifications?
Session notifications are reminders sent directly into Discord whenever an event starts.
Currently, GridScout supports the following sessions:
- Free Practice 1
- Free Practice 2
- Free Practice 3
- Sprint Qualifying
- Sprint Race
- Qualifying
- Grand Prix

## How do I set it up?
Setting up session notifications is easy.

1. Navigate to a **guild** which has invited GridScout.
2. Run the `/settings notifications <channel>` command, where `<channel>` is the channel you want to send the notifications to.
3. Following the command, you will be able to select the sessions you want to receive notifications for and how many minutes before the session starts you want to receive the notification.

<Note>
  <b>Note: </b>
  If you enable @everyone notifications, please ensure that GridScout has the `Mention Everyone` permission enabled.
</Note>

## How do I disable it?
1. Navigate to the same **guild** you setup the notifications for.
2. Run the `/settings notifications <channel>` command, where `<channel>` is the channel you want to disable the notifications for.
3. Unselect all sessions using the select menu

## Troubleshooting
If you are having issues with session notifications, please ensure that GridScout has the `Send Messages` permission enabled in the channel you want to send the notifications to.
