# Troubleshooting GridScout

If you're experiencing issues with GridScout, this guide will help you resolve common problems.

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bot Not Responding to Commands">
    If GridScout isn't responding to your slash commands, check the following:
    1. **Check permissions**: Ensure GridScout has the necessary permissions in
    your server:
    - Read Messages/View Channels
    - Send Messages
    - Embed Links
    - Use External Emojis
    2. **Bot status**: Check if GridScout is online. The bot
    may be down for maintenance or experiencing outages.
    3. **Command usage**: Make sure you're using the commands
    correctly. All commands start with a forward slash (`/`).
    4. **Discord service**: Check if Discord is experiencing any service issues that might
    affect bot functionality.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Incorrect or Outdated Data">
    If you're seeing outdated or incorrect data:
    1. **Data refresh timing**: GridScout updates
    its data as soon as our upstream provider does, which is
    normally the same day as the race event. Please wait a bit if you're checking
    immediately after a race.
    2. **Specific data concerns**: If you believe
    there's a persistent error in the data (not just timing-related), please
    report it in our [Support Server](https://discord.com/invite/SdK9QCquP4).
    3. **F1 data corrections**: Occasionally, official F1 results may be amended
    after initial publication (e.g., due to penalties). We update our data to
    reflect these changes as soon as possible.

## Error Messages

Here are solutions for common error messages:

### "I don't have permission to do that"

GridScout needs additional permissions in your server. Ask a server administrator to check the bot's role permissions.

### "This interaction failed"

This typically happens when:

1. You're trying to interact with a message that's too old (buttons expire after 15 minutes)
2. The bot underwent a routine update or maintenance while you were using it
3. There was a temporary connection issue

Try running the command again.

### "Unknown driver/team/circuit"

Check your spelling or try using a more common name/abbreviation through the autocomplete feature.

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Server-Specific Issues

If GridScout works in other servers but not yours:

1. Remove and re-invite the bot using the [invitation link](/inviting)
2. Verify your server isn't at the Discord integration limit
